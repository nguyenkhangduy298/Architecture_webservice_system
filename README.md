<h1 align="center">Learning Management Platform (Prototype of Canvas by Instructure) </h1>

## :dart: About ##

The application is an end-to-end prototype of the Canvas platform, a Learning Management System created by Instructure (https://www.instructure.com/canvas). It supports majority of functionalities presented by the actual website such as registration by a student or a faculty, creation of courses by a faculty, enrolling into courses by a student, adding assignments/quizzes, taking quizzes, grading, P2P messaging, pdf document view, real-time notifications, and so on. The application is developed majorly using the MERN stack technologies ( ReactJS, Spring Boot , Docker, Redis) and is made highly scalable and available using the 3-tier distributed system paradigm with fault tolerance and load balancing using the AWS EC2  with real-time data pipelining. The Backend is a RESTful service that handles all the requests from the client.
